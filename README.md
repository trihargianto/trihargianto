## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Yogyakarta, Indonesia with more than 10+ years of experience. I write code for the web. I've always been fascinated with web development and enjoy building web apps. 

Currently, I'm helping to build [Mamikos](https://mamikos.com) and also actively organizing [JogjaJS](https://github.com/jogjajs) community.
